      <h1>Mercedes Benz</h1>
      <p>
        For nearly a century, Mercedes-Benz has made it our mission to move the world. Through our employees and their achievements, we’ve created a company we can all be proud of.
        Mercedes-Benz was founded in 1926 by Karl Benz, Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach and Emil Jellinek, whose daughter Mercedes is our original namesake.
        With offices in 93 locations worldwide and a corporate headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany, our global presence continues to grow.
        Our vehicles are manufactured in 17 countries on five continents, and distributed all over the world.
        From the crumple zone in 1959 to the airbag in 1980 and PRE-SAFE® braking in 2002, Mercedes-Benz has invented many of the automotive technologies we see today.
      </p>
